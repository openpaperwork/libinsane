\page logging Libinsane logs

# Libinsane

By default, all logs from libinsane go to stderr. This may not be what you want
(debug logs are *very* verbose).

This can be changed by defining a callback to handle logs using functions from \ref log.h.


# Libinsane-gobject

You have to create an object implementing the interface Libinsane.LoggerInterface
and pass it to libinsane_logger_log().
